## Lessons Learned

Have a better understanding of how to use React Class components and manage state. Also with this project
it helped me better understand props as well since I had to develop the entire project I was forced
to learn to pass props down efficently.

This project has also helped me with understanding styling and css better since it really is my weak point
I originally wanted to use material UI however I was advised to not use it due to issues with
class components so I found a styling library that has the look and feel of material UI but
uses bootstrap.
